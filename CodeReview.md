# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction - Code Review

A code review was performed in the second week of my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone class. The code review was an informal review of the three original artifacts that I had chosen for inclusion in my ePortfolio.

The three artifacts that were informally reviewed were:
- Enhancement One, Software Engineering and Design, from my CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization class. A 3D object was rotated, lighted and manipulated using OpenGL and its API libraries from code written in C++. The enhancement to this artifact is to add additional lighting around the object and increase the complexity of the operations performed on the rotated object.

- Enhancement Two, Data Structures and Algorithms, from my CS-405 Secure Programming class. A software project set of files were analyzed for vulnerabilities and security flaws using visual observation and static analysis tools. The enhancement to this artifact is to find a more complex project set of C++ files to analyze to make the overall process more challenging and more realistic to the projects found in the real world.

- Enhancement Three, Databases, from my CS-340 Client Server Development class. Documents in a MongoDB database were created, read, updated and deleted using MongoDB functions from various Python modules. The enhancement to this artifact is to keep the functionality the same, but to use Java as the programming language instead of Python. This could relate to a project constraint that only Java can be used on the updates to the previous product (i.e., change languages, write in Java as a constraint from the customer).
