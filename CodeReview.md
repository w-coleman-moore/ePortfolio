## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

For the Software Engineering and Enhancement component, I chose my Final Project from CS-330 Comp Graphic and Visualization. I took that class in July 2020 and it is still fresh in my mind. This project demonstrates my ability to design and code in C++ and modern OpenGL to render an object in 3D. I chose a 4-leg table as the object to use when applying a texture to the object and lighting around the object. The Final Project showed my ability to generate accurate representations of a 3D object using API libraries and computer graphics, showed an application that responded to input devices (keyboard, mouse movement, mouse buttons) that allowed for successful navigation around the 3D object and through 3D space, and showed best practices in formatting, commenting and creating functional logic that produced a reliable fully functional program. I plan to enhance the project by adding additional lighting scenes around the table object.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

To demonstrate my abilities working with Algorithms and Data Structures, I chose my Final Project from CS-405 Secure Coding which I took in September 2019. In this project, I demonstrated my mastery of the following outcomes â€“ analyzing source code using manual and automated testing methods for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and code weaknesses, evaluating the vulnerabilities I identified using best practices and industry standards, and describing the implications on non-secure code, modifying the code by correcting weaknesses and reducing vulnerabilities, and recommending testing processes and necessary protocols for producing secure code. For enhancements, I plan to perform the same process I identified on the Final Project on a more complex selection of program code. There are many ways to violate coding practices when using C, some are more obvious problems, some are more subtle. The final CS-405 project included many issues that were more obvious that could be visually observed, I want to have code issues that are more difficult to see and use analysis tools that can find them.

**Category Three: Databases**

To demonstrate my abilities working with Databases, I chose my Final Project from CS-340 Client Server Development. I took that class in January 2020, and I used MongoDB and code written in Python to manipulate data in databases. This Final Project used a higher-level programming language (Python) and used advanced programming techniques that were suitable for use within a full-stack development environment. For my enhancement of this project, I plan to switch to Java to create the same functional results and use the same create, read, update, delete operations on the stock market database. The complex operations performed in the CS-340 final will also be created in Java, with the five top stocks reported by an industry selection I chose.
