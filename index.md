# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

I've been in the Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) Computer Science program since July 2017. I entered in the program with two years of credits from an Associates Degree I completed many years ago.

## Educational Reflection

At the beginning of my enrollment at SNHU, I started in the Information Technology program. After one term, I decided to switch to the Computer Science program because of my love of writing code and solving problems during my 30+ year career. I have an associate degree in Electrical Engineering, and I started my career designing hardware products for various companies I worked for. Soon thereafter, microprocessors became available, and I started designing those into my products. My work began shifting toward writing code and I learned assembly language coding on-the-job. C language tools began showing up within a few years and my efforts began migrating to writing code in C. C++, Java and Python followed over the years and I worked on many projects in those languages.
My interest in obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science was two-fold. One was for my satisfaction, achieving a goal that I had desired for many years. The other was my interest in learning the theory behind the coding; designing algorithms and data structures, learning about object-oriented programming, and learning the details behind programming in C++, Java, and Python.

## Portfolio Summary

The courses I have taken in the Computer Science program have added to my previous education and work experience as a software engineer. The courses have taught me about object oriented programming, the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC), database programming, mobile device programming and the programming languages C++, Python and Java.

When preparing my portfolio, I looked over the 27 courses I have taken at SNHU. I enjoyed the mathematical theory and applications taught in 

 and selected three courses that were significant to me.

All of the courses throughout the Computer Science program have helped me acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to position my self for a job in this industry. CS-250 taught me much about the Software Development Lifecyle and how communication with the client is important. CS-260 was a great lesson on data structures and algorithms. CS-310 showed me the basics of collaboration and explained how working together is necessary for large projects. CS-330 was an information look into the complexity of computer graphics. CS-340 helped me learn about create and use databases and showed how useful they can be.

While my learning was not restricted to these classes, I felt that these were some of the more important classes in the program, at least to me. From these classes I learned things I wasn't aware of initially. Because of that I wanted to incorporate the things I learned into my Portfolio. My first enhancement builds directly from my CS-330 Final Project and is aimed at increasing the complexity of the object rendered. I chose to do this do demonstrate my skills working with more complex problems. My second enhancement builds off of my IT-145 Final Project. I chose to work with that project in order to rewrite it in a different language and add what I learned from CS-250, by adding data structures and sorting algorithms into the mix. Finally, my third enhancement pulls from both DAT-220 and CS-340. Using the data provided in DAT-220, I wanted to take the MongoDB skills I learned in CS-340 and build an HTML interface to interact with the data.

Overall, these artifacts represent three distinct projects and don't necessarily mesh well together. However, I think that together, they allow me to demonstrate what I've learned throughout the program. I believe the enhancements made to these three projects represent my learning and display my competency in this program

## Preparing For The Future

My job in the military does not heavily rely on programming skills. However, having these skills could open up more opportunities in the future. By demonstrating my skills, I could move to a different shop and earn more programming experience to place on my resume. Right now, my career plans are up in the air. I have less than a year left in the military, but don't have anything concrete set up for when I get out. The most likely outcome is that I'll re-enlist for four additional years. This isn't ideal for me because four more years is more commitment that I'd like at this time, but I'd like the job security at least. Since the programming opportunity in the military deals with data analytics, I plan to focus on that and try to specialize in information management in the near future.
